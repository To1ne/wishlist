# My wishlist

This wishlist is created, based on an idea of [@csswizardry](http://csswizardry.com).

Please visit my wishlist at [iotcl.net/wishlist](http://iotcl.net/wishlist/).

# Your wishlist
To host your own wishlist:

- Fork this repository.
- Create a branch called 'gh-pages': `git checkout -b gh-pages`
- For each item add the following block to `_data/items.yml`

        - title: Product title
          description: Product description
          img: null.png
          link1: ./#
          price: EUR 5

# TODO
Some things still need some work:

- Automatically add the image (if found).
- Maybe categorize on price?
